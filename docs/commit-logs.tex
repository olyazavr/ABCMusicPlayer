\centerline{{\large \bf ABC Parser Project: Design Description }}
\bigskip\bigskip

We represent an ABC parser for music files as a series of well-structured interfaces.

\begin{verbatim}

* ee590b3 I broke everything so sorry
* 3059a70 More Listener work, maybe add Measure object?
* 68ded49 Added a method to scales which shifts a pitch up/down depending on the tone change given.
* c81a983 Fully working Scales method.
* 751818f Update Scales
* 203c05f Add documentation, fix a few Listener errors. We need to reallllly do more documentation
* 71c3021 Design revision
